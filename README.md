# Background
Were we'll assume the role of an advisor in one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Competitors are fierce, so we want to propose a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies. Instead of basing proposals on only returns and volatility, we want to include other factors that might impact the crypto market—leading to better performance for your portfolio.

# What's Been Created
A combination of financial Python programming skills with new unsupervised learning..

+ A Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods. 
+ A plot that visually shows the results

The CSV file that’s provided for this exercise contains the price change data of cryptocurrencies in different periods.
